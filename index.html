            <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h3>
            <p>"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                I signed for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life.
                Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Softwre Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

                <h3>Such a life-changing experience.</br> Highly recommended!</h3>
                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming 
                    step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                    and the staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was 
                    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews 
                    as an example of my developemt experience. It certainly helped me lans a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
